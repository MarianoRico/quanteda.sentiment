\description{
A \pkg{quanteda} \link[quanteda:dictionary]{dictionary} object containing the
VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) lexicon, a
rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to
sentiments expressed in social media.
}
\details{
The VADER lexicon contains 7,506 distinct English words and emoticons rated
for sentiment intensity. Each entry has an associated mean sentiment score
ranging from -4 (extremely negative) to +4 (extremely positive).

The original VADER lexicon contained 14 duplicate tokens (primarily
emoticons such as ":-p"). For this implementation, duplicates were merged by
combining their raw annotation scores and recomputing the mean sentiment and
standard deviation from the combined values. This process reduced the
dictionary from 7,520 to 7,506 unique entries.
